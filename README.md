Problem Statement:
The idea of using surveillance cameras to detect harassment against women on roads and 
provide location information to law enforcement stems from the pressing need to address 
gender-based violence and ensure the safety of women in public spaces. Harassment and assault 
against women in public areas are pervasive issues in many societies, causing physical and 
psychological harm, limiting women's freedom of movement, and perpetuating gender 
inequality.
The implementation of surveillance camera systems has become increasingly common in urban 
environments to enhance public safety and crime prevention. However, their potential to 
specifically address gender-based violence has not been fully explored. By leveraging computer 
vision and machine learning technologies, it is possible to develop intelligent systems that can 
actively detect and respond to instances of harassment, thereby creating a safer 
environment for women.
Innovative solution:
**CCTV camera detecting a crime scene and immediately sending a signal, along with the location 
information, to the police. This concept builds upon the previous explanation, with an added 
emphasis on transmitting the location details to enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement 
response. 
Here is an expanded overview:
CCTV camera placement and crime detection: CCTV cameras are strategically placed to monitor 
public areas, streets, or buildings for potential criminal activities. The cameras utilize features 
such as motion detection, facial recognition, or object tracking to identify suspicious behavior or 
events.
Real-time monitoring and event triggering: The CCTV camera feeds are continuously monitored, 
either by human operators or automated systems. These systems analyze the video streams in 
real-time to detect potential criminal activities, triggering an alert when certain criteria are met.
Location identification: In addition to detecting the crime, the CCTV camera system utilizes 
location-tracking technology, such as GPS or IP-based geolocation, to determine the precise 
location where the incident is taking place.
Signal transmission: When an alert is triggered, the CCTV system immediately sends a signal to a 
central monitoring station or directly to the nearest police station. The signal includes relevant information such as the nature of the incident, the video footage from the camera, and most 
importantly, the location coordinates of the crime scene.
Police response and location-based dispatch: Upon receiving the alert, the police assess the 
situation and use the location information provided by the CCTV system to determine the exact 
crime scene. This location-based data allows them to quickly dispatch officers to the specific 
area, minimizing response time.
Enhanced situational awareness: The live video feed from the CCTV camera, combined with the 
location information, provides the responding officers with real-time situational awareness. They 
can assess the situation remotely, gather additional information, and make more informed 
decisions about their response.
Technological stack:
CCTV Cameras: High-quality cameras equipped with advanced features such as motion detection, 
facial recognition, object tracking, and potentially geolocation capabilities. These cameras 
capture the video footage of the monitored area.
Video Analytics: Software or algorithms that analyze the video feed from the CCTV cameras in 
real-time. These analytics systems can detect suspicious activities or events based on predefined 
criteria, triggering an alert when a potential crime is detected.Signal Transmission: Depending on the infrastructure and requirements, the CCTV system can use 
various communication methods to transmit the alert and location information to the police. This 
can include:
Wired Connectivity: Ethernet or fiber-optic cables to connect the cameras and the monitoring 
station or police headquarters.
Wireless Connectivity: Wi-Fi, cellular networks, or specialized wireless protocols to transmit the 
alerts and data over the air.
Internet Protocol (IP) Networking: Utilizing IP-based communication protocols for transmitting 
data over the internet or private networks.
Central Monitoring Station/Command Center: A control center where the CCTV feeds are 
monitored by human operators or automated systems. This station serves as the hub for 
receiving alerts and managing the response process.
Location Services: To determine the precise location of the crime scene, the CCTV system can 
utilize location services such as:
GPS (Global Positioning System): Cameras equipped with GPS modules can provide accurate 
coordinates of their position.
IP-based Geolocation: Using IP addresses and databases to approximate the location based on the camera's network connection.
Integration with Police Systems: The CCTV system needs to integrate with the police 
infrastructure to transmit the alert and location information effectively. This integration can 
involve:
Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) Systems: The CCTV system can interface with CAD systems used 
by the police to receive and manage emergency calls and incidents.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Integrating with GIS platforms allows for mapping and 
visualization of crime locations and optimal route planning for police dispatch.
Data Storage and Management: The CCTV system requires storage infrastructure to store the 
captured video footage for review and potential evidence. This can involve on-site or cloud-based 
storage solutions, depending on the scale and requirements of the system.
